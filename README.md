# Real-time Social Media Engagement Tool

## Project Overview

The Real-time Social Media Engagement Tool is designed to automate social media interactions. By leveraging Zapier for automation and the OpenAI ChatGPT API for generating responses, this tool monitors social media platforms (such as Facebook) for new interactions and responds in real-time.

## Project Objectives

- **Enhance Social Media Presence**: Ensure timely and relevant engagement with followers.
- **Automate Responses**: Reduce manual effort by automating responses to mentions, comments, or messages.
- **Increase Engagement**: Improve interaction rates by responding promptly and accurately.

## Deliverables

- **Automated Response System**: Tool that generates responses to social media interactions.
- **Content Suggestion Feature**: Suggests content to post based on trending topics and interactions.
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: Dashboard for tracking social media activity and interactions.
- **Integration Setup**: Instructions and configurations for integrating with various social media platforms.

## Design
### Design Description

1. **Monitoring**: Zapier monitors social media accounts for mentions, comments, or messages.
2. **Trigger**: When an interaction is detected, Zapier triggers a request to the ChatGPT API.
3. **Response Generation**: The ChatGPT API generates a response or suggests content.
4. **Publishing**: Zapier publishes the response or suggested content on the social media platform.
5. **Dashboard Update**: The monitoring dashboard is updated with the new interaction and response details.

### Workflow

1. **Step 1**: Zapier monitors social media accounts.
2. **Step 2**: Interaction detected by Zapier.
3. **Step 3**: Zapier sends the interaction data to the ChatGPT API.
4. **Step 4**: ChatGPT API generates a response or content suggestion.
5. **Step 5**: Zapier publishes the response or content on the social media account.
6. **Step 6**: Dashboard updates with the new data.

## Test Cases

### Positive Cases

- **TC#1**: Valid Interaction Detection
  - **Description**: Ensure Zapier detects and triggers on valid social media interactions.
  - **Expected Result**: Interaction is detected, and the response process begins.

- **TC#2**: Successful Response Generation
  - **Description**: Verify the ChatGPT API generates an appropriate response for a valid interaction.
  - **Expected Result**: Appropriate response is generated and published.

- **TC#3**: Content Suggestion
  - **Description**: Ensure the system suggests relevant content based on the interaction.
  - **Expected Result**: Content suggestions are relevant and useful.

- **TC#4**: Dashboard Update
  - **Description**: Verify the monitoring dashboard updates correctly after an interaction.
  - **Expected Result**: Dashboard reflects the new interaction and response details.

- **TC#5**: Multi-platform Interaction
  - **Description**: Test the system's ability to handle interactions from multiple social media platforms.
  - **Expected Result**: Interactions from all connected platforms are detected and responded to appropriately.

### Negative Cases

- **TC#1**: Invalid Interaction Detection
  - **Description**: Check if the system handles invalid or irrelevant interactions correctly.
  - **Expected Result**: No trigger or response is generated for invalid interactions.

- **TC#2**: API Failure Handling
  - **Description**: Test system behavior when the ChatGPT API fails to respond.
  - **Expected Result**: System logs the failure and does not crash, providing a fallback response.

- **TC#3**: Unauthorized Access Attempt
  - **Description**: Ensure the system handles unauthorized access attempts securely.
  - **Expected Result**: Unauthorized attempts are logged and access is denied.

- **TC#4**: Network Failure
  - **Description**: Test system behavior in the event of network failure during API call.
  - **Expected Result**: System retries the request or logs the failure appropriately.

- **TC#5**: Incorrect Permissions
  - **Description**: Ensure the system handles cases where it lacks necessary permissions on social media platforms.
  - **Expected Result**: System logs the permission error and notifies the user.
